ALL OF THESE ONLY WORK THROUGH ARUDINO IDE AND USING WEMOS D1 MINI MICROCONTROLLERS (PLEASE READ COMMENTS IN EACH FILE FOR IN-DEPTH FUNCTIONS)
This is a bunch of code made for D1 minis using Neopixel LED strips. The "Flashing Light Code" is for a strip of flashing red. "sketch_mar24a" is a modification that utilizes activation from a separate sensor.
"led-neopixel" serves as a testing ground for your LED strip.
"idk" is the sensor data code that helps communicate to "sketch_mar24a."
